# Zone-protect
A protection plugin for Sponge designed to be flexible to suit the needs of the server. 

Zone-Protect is a free and open source plugin for anyone to use and even contribute to. 

## Supported Platforms

Currently we support the following

- Sponge Vanilla API 8 (1.16)
- Sponge Forge API 8 (1.16)

And we plan on supporting more in the future. 

Zone-Protect is designed to take advantage of modern code and will be updating with Sponge. 
Due to this we have a Java version requirement of Java 16 at minimum and this will likey update as older Sponge versions are dropped from support.
